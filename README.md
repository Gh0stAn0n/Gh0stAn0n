### Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Ethan, iâ€™m a french-israeli of 22 years old and a proud IDF veteran where i have served in near to 3 years as a combat medic in the anti-terrorist Kfir brigade at Douhifat unit.
i'm also a graduate Cyber Protection and Information Security from John bryce and a Penetration Tester and Exploit Dev from ITsafe college.

Iâ€™m passionated by history and science since iâ€™m young: Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, etcâ€¦ but above all, anything related to the technologie fields: Video Games, Artificial Intelligence (A.I) and the power provided by Cybersecurity/crime, which is another world from another dimension.

My favorite cyber field is Penetration Testing but iâ€™m getting interested in Malwares and Reverse Engineering too.
Iâ€™m currently very active on multiple CTF platforms such as: FBCTF, HTB, pwntilldawn, intent ectâ€¦ to improve my skills in the domain.
Iâ€™m also a self-taught and an out-of-the-box thinker.

Iâ€™m as well deeply working on learning scientifics based programming languages such as Julia, Matlab and R for scientific purposes, and i would love to write my very own programming language for all kinds of purposes: Data Sciences (Physics, Engineering, Space, ectâ€¦) Video Games, A.I, Hacking; with GUI possibilities.
